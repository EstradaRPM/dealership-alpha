/**
 * Pure read-model builder for **The Reveal** (#319, design record
 * `docs/planning/engagement-spine.md`) — the shared close-of-bite engagement
 * beat. T1's daily Reveal reuses the funnel + gross + inventory-buyer match
 * tally already assembled for `DayRecapModel` (#199/#253) and reframes them
 * as a plain-language scoreline plus a starred-reaction feed. No new
 * modeling: the renderer aggregates and phrases what the sim already emits.
 *
 * Self-similar by design (design record §2): this same shape — one scoreline
 * + a reactions list, each reaction starring an entity with a fate — is what
 * plug-ins feed into. S1 (#319) shipped exactly one reaction, the aggregate
 * match summary. S2 (#320) adds individual starred win reactions, ranked by
 * drama off the day's closes; sale losses (#321) and F&I (plug-in #2) are
 * later plug-ins onto the same `reactions[]` shape.
